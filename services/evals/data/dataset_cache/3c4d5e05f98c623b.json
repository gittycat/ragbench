In 1776, dancers from the school were employed by Prince Pyotr Vasilyevich Ouroussoff and the English theatrical entrepreneur Michael Maddox, to form part of their new theatre company. Originally performing in privately owned venues, they later acquired the Petrovsky Theatre, which, as a result of fires and erratic redevelopment, would later be rebuilt as today's Bolshoi Theatre. While some guest dancers come and go from other very prestigious ballet companies\u2014like the Mariinsky and American Ballet Theatre\u2014many company dancers are graduates of the academy. In 1989, Michael Shannon was the first American ballet dancer to graduate from the Bolshoi Ballet Academy and join the Bolshoi Ballet company.","relevance_score":1.0}]},{"id":"ragbench:covidqa:0","question":"What is Denmark's estimated mean percentage [95% credible interval] of total population infected as of 28th March?","expected_answer":"Based on the provided pieces of context, Denmark's estimated mean percentage of total population infected as of 28th March is 1.1% with a 95% credible interval.","query_type":"factoid","difficulty":"medium","domain":"medical","is_unanswerable":false,"metadata":{"subset":"covidqa","original_index":0},"gold_passages":[{"doc_id":"covidqa:doc:0","chunk_id":"covidqa:doc:0:chunk:0","text":"Title: Estimating the number of infections and the impact of non-\nPassage: Denmark 1.1%","relevance_score":1.0},{"doc_id":"covidqa:doc:1","chunk_id":"covidqa:doc:1:chunk:0","text":"Title: Estimating the number of infections and the impact of non-\nPassage: 26.
