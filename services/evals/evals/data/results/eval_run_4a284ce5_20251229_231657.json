The second node focuses on AI and programming, discussing 'Natural languages are ambiguous' and 'prompting might evolve a pseudo natural language', having no connection to great work qualities. The third node discusses technical AI capabilities, mentioning 'it's in the context window the model has direct access to it', which is about AI technical features rather than work qualities. Since no relevant nodes were retrieved to answer the question about the three qualities needed for great work, the contextual precision score is at its lowest possible value."
